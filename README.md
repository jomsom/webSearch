This is a web portal. Currently, it is in very early stage of the development. This is going 
to be a data driven website using django 1.9, html5, javaScript, Json, and CSS. My goal is to 
make it a financial information web portal where user can use some sort of financial analysis
tools. Any suggestion would be greatly appreciated.
